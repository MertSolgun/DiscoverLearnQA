    question: "What is the process of photosynthesis in plants?",
    answer:
      "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. It generally involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a by-product.",

    question: "How does the water cycle work?",
    answer:
      "The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It involves processes like evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. Water evaporates from the Earth's surface, rises and cools, condenses into rain or snow in clouds, and falls again to the surface as precipitation.",

    question: "What causes the different seasons on Earth?",
    answer:
      "The different seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth's rotational axis away or toward the Sun as it travels through its year-long path around the Sun. The Earth's axis is tilted from perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic by 23.5Â°. This tilting is what gives us the four seasons of the year - spring, summer, autumn (fall), and winter.",

    question: "What is the significance of the Theory of Relativity?",
    answer:
      "The Theory of Relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein, is a fundamental theory in physics which describes the laws of physics in the context of moving frames of reference. It consists of two parts: the Special Theory of Relativity, which applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity, and the General Theory of Relativity, which applies to the gravitational force, particularly in relation to its effect on the curvature of spacetime.",

    question: "How do volcanoes form?",
    answer:
      "Volcanoes form when magma from within the Earth's upper mantle works its way to the surface. At the surface, it erupts to form lava flows and ash deposits. Over time, as the volcano continues to erupt, it will grow larger with each eruption. Volcanoes can form both on land and under the ocean.",

    question: "How does a black hole form in space?",
    answer:
      "A black hole forms from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion. If the core's mass is more than about three times the mass of the Sun, the forces of gravity overwhelm and the core collapses to form a black hole. Black holes have such strong gravitational pulls that not even light can escape from them.",

    question: "What are the primary causes of climate change??",
    answer:
      "The primary cause of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These activities increase the concentration of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases, leading to a rise in Earth's average temperature.",
